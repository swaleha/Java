create a class HelloWorld:

Go to Eclipse IDE, click on new -> create a new Java Project -> Give a project name
click on new-> class -> give the class name -> check the public static void main(string args[]) method -> click on finish


class HelloWorld gets created, which is as follows:

class HelloWorld{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("hello world!");  //type this output statement within the class
  }
}
 
Right click on the file from the tree view and run as Java Application.
The output hello world! gets desplayed in the console.

line 1: This is the class definition

        class is a keyword and HelloWorld is the class name, which is an identifier 
        
        opening and closing braces mark the scope of the class
        
line 2: pubilc static void main(String args[])

        This line demarcates the start point of execution

        public: It is a keyword and access modifier. Which specifies that the main() method can be accessed from anywhere
        
        static: Static keyword specifies that main() method can be accessed without object creation
        
        void: void specifies that main() method doesn't return anything
        
        main: This is given in the JVM configuration.
        
        String []: This specifies that main method() accepts only one argument, argument should be an array. And array elements should be of type string.
          
          
  line 3: This displays hello world! followed by a new line to the console.

        System is a pre-defined class which has access to the system and out is a variable of output stream that is connected to the 
        
        console. println is used to display the content on the console with a new line.
        
        
       Running Java progrma through command prompt:
       
       1. Edit source code in text editor and save it
       2. Go to the command prompt
       3. Go to location where source code file is saved.
       4. Compile using javac filename.java, specify the filename used. Java compiler converts source code into bytecode which is a .class file 
       5. Run the .class using java filename, JVM converts bytecode into executable  which is .exe file
