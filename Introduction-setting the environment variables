Java is -

* object-oriented
* class-based
* concurrent
* platform independent
* general purpose programming language

However, JDK, JRE and JVM are platform dependent because the configuration is based on their operating system. 

JDK(Java Development Tool Kit): It is comprised of Java Compiler(Javacc),Jar files,debugger and Javadocs. This is used by Java developers.
JRE(Java Runtime Environment): It is used by the users to run Java programs. It comprised of Java libraries to run Java programs.
JVM(Java Virtual Machine): This is a abstract machine whose specification provides runtime environment which is used to run bytecode.

Setting the environment variables for Java:

1. Download Java from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html either 32 bit or 64 bit based on your operating system
2. Install Java on your machine. Go to the location where it is installed, copy the entire path(till the bin directory of jdk).
3. Right click on my computer, go to properties -> advanced system properties -> under the Advanced tab click on environment variables
4. Click on New button under the user variables 
5. Give the variable name as JAVA_HOME and paste the Java installation path as the variable value
6. Click Ok. Again click on OK.

Now the environment variables are set.

To check if Java is installed correctly:

1.press windows+R button
2.Type cmd and click on ok
3. type java -version

 This shows the version of Java installed on the system.
 
 Java code can edited in various text editors like notepad, textpad but Eclipse IDE(Integrated Development Environment) or similaer IDEs are preferably chosen for ease of use.
